## Description

Despite having a look similar to many other ergo monoblock angled
keyboards, this build has a couple of unique features:

- it has been designed with [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org/). This EDA
  tool deserves more love, so I published the project & library files
  under CC0 1.0 licence.

- its MCU board is a Nucleo STM32WB55CG USB dongle (MB1293); it is
  surface mounted on the top to showcase it ☺

Regarding the other features, they are more classic:

- it has been designed for Kailh Choc switches with MBK keycaps
  (L=17.5mm × H=16.5mm)

- it is powered by ZMK; only USB HID is supported so far.

- it features an I²C 128x32 OLED screen (SSD1306)
